    This class defines an annotation scale as a context object.

    The context is the current viewport scale which can determine the properties
	of annotations in the viewport. You can get objects of this class using the 
	OdDbAnnotationScale context collection. An annotation scale is the ratio of paper 
	units to drawing units, for example, 1 mm to 1 meter for a scale of 0.01.
