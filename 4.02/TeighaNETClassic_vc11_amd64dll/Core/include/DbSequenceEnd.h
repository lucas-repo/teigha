/** \details
    This class represents SequenceEnd (Seqend) entities in an OdDbDatabase instance.  
    
    \remarks
    OdDbSequenceEnd entities are automatically created and handled by Teigha for
    complex objects such as OdDb2dPolyline and OdDbBlockReference.
     
    Client applications may add extended data or extension dictionaries to these 
    entities, but should not create or delete them.

    These entities have no associated geometries.
 
    \remarks
    Do not derive from this class.
