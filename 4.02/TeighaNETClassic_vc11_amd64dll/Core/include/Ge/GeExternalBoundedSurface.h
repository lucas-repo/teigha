/** \details
    This class represents bounded surfaces, whose definitions are external to the OdGe library.
    
    \remarks
    Each instance of ns OdGeExternalBoundedSurface is comprosed of an instance
    of an OdExternalSurface and a collection of instances of OdGeCurveBoundary.
    
    OdGeExternalBoundedSurface instances can be treated as any other OdGeSurface. 
    
    You can access the OdGeExternalBoundedSurface as a corresponding native OdGeSurface, if such a corresponding
    surface exists, or you may (more efficiently) access the external data in its native form.
    
    One example of using OdGeExternalBoundedSurface is to access an ACIS surface. 
   
    Corresponding C++ library: TD_Ge
