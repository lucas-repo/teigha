/** \details
    This class represents the boundary geometry (face loops) on a bounded surface.

    \remarks
    Each face loop consists of four arrays:
    
    * 3D curve or position pointers
    * 2D parameter space curve pointers
    * 3D orientations
    * 2D orientations
    
    There is a one-to-one correspondence between elements in the arrays, although certain 
    elements of a given array could be NULL, or meaningless.

    Loop degeneracies are represented as follows:
    
    * The entire loop degenerates to a single model space point, which is
      represented by the tuple (numElements = 1, position3d, curve2d).
      The curve2d may be NULL. The edge sense, and the curve2d sense are
      irrelevant. isDegenerate() method allows the determination of this
      condition on a loop.
    * A loop consisting of one or more model space degeneracies
      is represented as the general case with those edges that are
      degenerate represented by position3d. This implies that in the
      general case, model space geometry of a curve boundary may consist of
      curve3d and/or position3d pointers. Consequently, this geometry is
      obtained by the user as entity3d pointers. The degeneracy of a
      constituent edge can be detected by the type of the model space
      geometry.
   
    This class also supports the ownership of its geometry. Being the
    owner of its geometry would cause it to remove the geometry on
    destruction of an instance of the class.
