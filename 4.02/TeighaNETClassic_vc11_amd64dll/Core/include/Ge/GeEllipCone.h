/** \details
    This class represents right elliptical cones.

    \remarks
    A elliptical cone is defined by its 
    * major and minor radii
    * origin (a point on the axis of symmetry)
    * axis of symmetry
    * major axis
    * height

    The "base" is the cross section which contains the origin.

    The major and minor radii must be greater than 0.  

    The cone may extend on either side of the base.

    The half angle is constrained to the interval (0, OdaPI/2),
    and is measured from the symmetric axis of this elliptical cone to a point on the major axis.

    A negative angle results in an apex which is opposite the direction of the
    symmetric axis.

    Parameter V is the revolution angle measured from the refAxis (which 
    is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry).  For a closed cone,
    it defaults to [-OdaPI, OdaPI).  The positive direction of V
    is defined by applying the right hand rule applied along the
    axis of symmetry.  The surface is periodic in V with a period of Oda2PI.

    The angle of point on an ellipse is measured by projecting
    the point on the ellipse perpendicular to major axis onto a
    circle whose center is the center of the ellipse and whose
    radius is the major radius of the ellipse.

    The angle between the major axis of the ellipse, and a vector from
    the center of the ellipse to the intersection point with the circle, 
    measured counterclockwise, is the angle of the point on the ellipse.

    Parameter U varies along the axis of symmetry.  U is dimensionless,
    and increases in the direction of the axis of symmetry. 
    U = 0 corresponds to center of the base of this cone, 
    and U = 1 corresponds to the apex of this cone. 

    [umin, umax] by [vmin, vmax] defines a conical patch with four sides
    bounded by two straight lines (at angles vmin and vmax), and two
    circular arcs (at umin and umax).  The following must be observed
    when defining a cone:

    * umin < umax
    * |vmax - vmin| <= Oda2PI
    * majorRadius > 0.0
    * minorRadius > 0.0

    The height interval of this elliptical cone is specified relative to its origin
    (note that the height increases in the direction of the symmetric
    axis).
