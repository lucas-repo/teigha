    This class represents intersections of 2D curves.

    \remarks
    The intersection object links to 2D curve objects but does not contain
	them. Calculation of the intersection is performed by a calling function, 
	which owns the intersection output.
	
	If one of the curve objects is deleted, the intersection must be recalculated.
