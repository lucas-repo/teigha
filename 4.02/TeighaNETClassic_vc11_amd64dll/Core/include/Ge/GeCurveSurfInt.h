/** \details
    This class represents intersections of 3D curves and surfaces.

    \remarks
    The intersection object links to curve and surface objects, but does not
	contain them. Calculation of the intersection is performed by a calling 
	function, which owns the intersection output.
	
	If one of the objects is deleted, the intersection must be recalculated.
