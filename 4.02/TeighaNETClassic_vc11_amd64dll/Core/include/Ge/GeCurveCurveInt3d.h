    This class represents intersections of 3D curves.
    Currently not implemented.

    \remarks
    The intersection object links to 3D curve objects but does not contain
	them. Calculation of the intersection is performed by a calling function, 
	which owns the intersection output.
	
	If one of the curve objects is deleted, the intersection must be recalculated.
