    This class represents, as OdGeCurve3d curves, 3D curves whose definitions are external to the OdGe library.
    
    \remarks
    OdGeExternalCurve3d curve instances can be treated as any other OdCurve3d. 
    
    You can access the OdGeExternalCurve3d as a corresponding native OdGeCurve3d curve, if such a corresponding
    curve exists, or you may (more efficiently) access the external data in its native form.
    
    One example of using OdGeOdGeExternalCurve3d is to represent an ACIS curve. 
    
    Corresponding C++ library: TD_Ge
