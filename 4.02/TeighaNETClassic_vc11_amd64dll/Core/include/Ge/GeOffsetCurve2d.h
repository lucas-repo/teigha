/** \details
    This class represents 2D curves that are exact offsets of other curves.

    \remarks
    Every GeOffsetCurve2d contains a pointer to the curve from which it is offest.
    Modifying the base curve modifies the offset curve. Modifying the offset curve
    does not modify the base curve. setInterval() for an offset curve result create a curve that
    is an offset of the specified interval in the base curve.

    This curve may be self-intersecting, even if the base curve is not.

    Positive offset distances at any point on the base curve are defined as 90° counterclockwise
    from the tangent of the base curve at that point.

    An offset curve with a 0.0 offset distance is exact replica of the base curve. An offseet curve with
    a non-zero 0.0 offset distance has a continuity of one less than that of the base curve. 
    To insure that the offset curve is a valid curve, the base curve must have a continuity
    of at least 1.
