/** \details
    This class represents cones with a circular base.

    \remarks
    A circular cone is defined by:

    * axis of symmetry
    * height
    * half angle (the angle between the generating line and the axis of symmetry)
    * origin (a point on the axis of symmetry)
    * radius at the origin 

    The cross section containing the origin is refered to as the base. 
    The radius at the base cannot be zero.  
    This cone may extend on either side of the base.

    The half angle is constrained to the interval (-OdaPI/2, OdaPI/2),
    and is measured from the symmetric axis of the cone.
    A negative angle results in an apex on the opposite direction of the
    symmetric axis.

    Parameter V is the angle of revolution measured from the refAxis
    (an axis perpendicular to the axis of symmetry). For a closed cone,
    it defaults to [-OdaPI, OdaPI). The positive V direction is defined 
    by applying the right hand rule along the axis of symmetry.  
    The surface is periodic in V with a period of Oda2PI.

    Parameter U varies along the axis of symmetry. U is dimensionless
    and increases in the direction of the axis of symmetry. 
    U = 0 corresponds to center of the cone base, 
    and U = 1 corresponds to the cone apex. 

    [umin, umax] x [vmin, vmax] defines a four sided conical patch
    bounded by two straight lines (at angles vmin and vmax), and two
    circular arcs (at umin and umax). The following must be observed
    when defining a cone:

    * umin < umax
    * |vmax - vmin| <= Oda2PI.
    * baseRadius > 0.0

    The height interval of this cone is specified relative to its origin
    (with the height increasing in the direction of the symmetric
    axis).
