    This class represents unbounded surfaces, whose definitions are external to the OdGe library, as OdGeSurface.
    
    \remarks
    OdGeExternalSurface instances can be treated as any other OdGeSurface. 
    
    You can access the OdGeExternalSurface as a corresponding native OdGeSurface, if such a corresponding
    surface exists, or you may (more efficiently) access the external data in its native form.
    
    One example of using OdGeExternalSurface is to access an ACIS surface. 
    
    Corresponding C++ library: TD_Ge
