    This class represents, as OdGeCurve2d curves, 2D curves whose definitions are external to the OdGe library.

    OdGeExternalCurve2d curve instances can be treated as any other OdCurve2d. 
    
    You can access the OdGeExternalCurve2d as a corresponding native OdGeCurve2d curve, if such a corresponding
    curve exists, or you may (more efficiently) access the external data in its native form.
