/** \details

    <group OdGi_Classes> 
    This class implements conveyor nodes performing selections. 
    
    \remarks
    
    Behavior of this node depends on the selection mode.    
    *  If the mode is "fence", the points specify polyline vertices.
    *  If the mode is "crossing" or "window", the points specify polygon vertices. If exactly two points
        are specified, the polygon is rectangle, with the points opposite vertices.

    For any input primitive, this node performs the following actions:

    1.  It checks for primitive intersections with the polygon border. 
    
    2.  If intersections are found, the node MARKS current drawable, and stops to handle the primitive.

    3.  If the mode is mode is "crossing", and the primitive is inside the polygon, the node
        node MARKS the current drawable and stops to handle the primitive.
        
    4.  If the mode is "window", and primitive is outside the polygon, the node
        MARKS the current drawable and stops to handle the primitive.

    To MARK the current drawable is means to currentDrawableDesc()->markBySelection(true).
    If the drawable is neither a compound object nor uses nesting, means currentDrawableDesc()->markToSkip(true)

    This conveyor node is used for implementation OdGsBaseVectorizeView::select()
    and does not produce any output.
