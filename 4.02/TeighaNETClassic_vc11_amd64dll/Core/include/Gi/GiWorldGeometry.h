    This class defines functions that allow entities to vectorize themselves.

    Vectorization with the methods of this class are viewport independent. 
    For viewport specific vectorization, use subViewportDraw() instead of subWorldDraw().

    An OdGiWorldGeometry object is part of the OdGiWorldDraw argument passed to the subWorldDraw()
    method of an entity.

    Model coordinates are applied to all geometry in this class except for setExtents().
