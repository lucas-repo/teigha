    <group OdGi_Classes>
    This class preprocesses geometry before xforming it by 
    perspective matrix.
    Remarks.
    Circles, arcs, ellipses, texts are tesselated, although for export tasks 
    it may be more useful to switch arcs to nurbs curves.
    
    Polylines, polygons, meshes, shells, xlines, rays, and NURBS curves are passed through.
    
    Images and metafiles are not passed.
