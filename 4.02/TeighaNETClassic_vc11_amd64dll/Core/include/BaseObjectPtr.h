    \remarks
    Smart pointers relieve the programmer of having to determine when objects are no longer needed, or having to delete
    them at that time.

    Each object referenced by a SmartPointer (henceforth 'referenced object') 
    maintains a reference count; i.e., how many SmartPointers are referencing it.
    When the reference count reaches zero, the referenced object is deleted.
