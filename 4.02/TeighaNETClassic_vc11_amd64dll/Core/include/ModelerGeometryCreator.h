    This utility class loads and saves SAT/SAB files, and performs other
    miscellaneous other ACIS-related operations.

    The functions in this class can do the following: 
    * Create OdModelerGeometry instances from a specified input stream.
    * Save SAT/SAB data from an OdModelerGeometry instance.
    * Create region entities from sets of curves.

    Corresponding C++ library: ModelerGeometry

      Since OdModelerGeometry does not support multi-body SAT files, such files 
      are divided into a set of single body OdModelerGeometry objects
