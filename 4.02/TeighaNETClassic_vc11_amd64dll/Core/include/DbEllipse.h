/** \details
  <group OdDb_Classes>

  This class implements the ellipse object (Ellipse entity) in the database. This class 
  inherits the base functionality of entities. The ellipse entity can represent either an 
  elliptical closed figure (ellipse) or unclosed elliptical segment (elliptical arc) in world
  space. When the start angle coincides with the end angle, the figure is closed and this 
  class represents an ellipse. When the start angle differs from the end angle on 1e-6, the 
  figure is unclosed and this class represents an elliptical arc. 

  \remarks
  The ellipse must have (StartAngle = 0) and (EndAngle = Oda2PI).
  The elliptical arc has (EndAngle - StartAngle) > 1e-6.
  The radius ratio must be in the range [1e-6 to 1.0].
