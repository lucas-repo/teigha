    This class is the base class for platform specific progress metering

    \remarks
    This class receives progress notifications during various database operations such
    as loading or saving a file.

    Calls to an instance of this class will always come in the following order:

    1.  setLimit (called once).
    2.  start (called once).
    3.  meterProgress (called repeatedly).
    4.  stop (called once).
