    This class represents BlockEnd entities in an OdDbDatabase instance.

    OdDbBlockEnd entities are automatically created and handled by Teigha for
    each OdDbBlockTableRecord object.
     
    Client applications may add extended data or extension dictionaries to these 
    entities, but should not create or delete them.
    
    These entities have no associated geometries.

    \remarks
    Do not derive from this class.
